DONE:
 - finalize paths generation:
    - debuggng and refactoring debug (v)
    - host save games dir (stub and mock saves and empires) (x)
    - sockets temp (v)
    - backup (v)
    - platform identity (v), integrating Plad_ID into the system as a component (v)

    -- refactoor decompose and refactor PlatformIdentity with dependencies in mind(x)
    {
       platform identity should have Util with get_some_paths methods
    }
    - refactor monitor: directory and file creation should be delegeted to StashSaves::Path

FIRST OF ORDER:
   - try to use <syncstream> for output, if gcc supports it;
   - look thru other things too, write it down
   - we need to incapsulte inter-component communication and use socket as first version of implementation;
   - indexes should notify Monitor about files being created or deleted, monitor builds an array of files back up, let's say 10 files a portion, it copy the files and then removes them from original directory.

PROCESS MANAGEMENT:
 - automation of creation of new issues time entries on Toggl (v)
 - automate issue closing time entry on Toggl(if possible), or integrate/migrate to other option of hooks automation (postponed)

CODE MANAGEMENT:
 - decompose Platform Identity & Component Util https://github.com/ol3h-unag1/stash_stellaris_saves/issues/2
 - consider to use tempalates for versioning instead of namespaces/inline namespaces
 - add code generation for types like E_Platform_ID: type, type's correct and incorrect states, types to_string function, etc like serialization
